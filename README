# PHPTAL - Template Attribute Language for PHP


Usage requirements
==================

To use PHPTAL in your projects, you will only require PHP 5.1.2 or later.

If you want to use the builtin internationalisation system (I18N) the gettext extension must be compiled into PHP (--with-gettext).


Non-PEAR install
================

To run you only need PHPTAL.php and files in PHPTAL directory. Other files are for unit tests and PEAR installer.

Get the latest PHPTAL package from http://phptal.org.

    tar zxvf PHPTAL-X.X.X.tar.gz
    mv PHPTAL-X.X.X/PHPTAL* /path/to/your/php/include/path/
